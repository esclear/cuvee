Achieve first results:
1. get fusion right
2. get function matching right
3. implement main loop
4. check which proofs work with base case factoring and promotion

Further work
1. find liftings (promotions) automatically
2. parse full TIP, maybe Haskell?

Argument factoring
- find out when we can drop guards, because "nil" is not actually looked at and can in fact be arbitrary (a parameter?)
